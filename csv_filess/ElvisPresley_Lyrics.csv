Jailhouse Rock,1957-09-24,If I Can Dream: The Very Best of Elvis,"77 ContributorsJailhouse Rock Lyrics
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there, they began to wail
The band was jumping, and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those locked-out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty, and he said, ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock

We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out

If I Can Dream,1968-11-05,The 50 Greatest Hits,"31 ContributorsIf I Can Dream Lyrics
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true? Oh, why?

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?

We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)

Deep in my heart, there's a trembling question
Still, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
And while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right now

Let it come true right now

In the Ghetto,1969-04-14,If I Can Dream: The Very Best of Elvis,"35 ContributorsIn the Ghetto Lyrics
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man someday
A-take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way?

Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And as her young man dies (In the ghetto)
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

And his mama cries

Are You Lonesome Tonight?,1960-11-01,If I Can Dream: The Very Best of Elvis,"35 ContributorsAre You Lonesome Tonight? Lyrics
Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare, and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
