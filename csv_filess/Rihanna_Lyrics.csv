On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
You might also like
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie88Embed"

California King Bed,2010-11-12,Loud (Deluxe Edition),"52 ContributorsTranslationsहिन्दीEspañolFrançaisCalifornia King Bed Lyrics
Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Sak pasé!

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh

Same Ol’ Mistakes,2016-01-28,ANTI,"99 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisPortuguêsSame Ol’ Mistakes Lyrics
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know
You might also like
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)

And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don't have what it takes)
