A mosquito, my libido, yeah

Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills

Before the night owl
Before the animal noises

Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes

Words are sawn-off shotguns

Regular exercise at the gym three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams

Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit

Calm

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
(Underneath the guise of a smile)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry

How 'bout you?
How 'bout you?

You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye baby
(How 'bout you)

Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave

Go stay at your friend's house or something

Go stay with your homeboys you was talking to

With you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Mustard on that beat, ho

It was all so overwhelming
She was like, ""I don't know, don't tell me""
He had eyes that said, ""Girl, I'll save you""
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, ""Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong""

But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart (Alright, yo)

She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi (Uh-huh), rub up in the movies (Uh-huh)
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her mom's
She calls me ""heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down ""I hate ya""
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all
(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me (Why did you have to run your game?)

When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Aren't overflowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me (I will know you're mine)
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly, butterfly (My butterfly)
