Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight

Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby

My snowman and me, eh

Baby

Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?

Helium,2017-02-09,Fifty Shades Darker (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),"34 ContributorsHelium Lyrics
I'm trying but I keep falling down
I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone

Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need

And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around

Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul
