Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel

One Step Ahead,1965-01-01,ARETHA,"15 ContributorsOne Step Ahead Lyrics
I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from youYou might also like8Embed"

Love was always supposed to be
Something wonderful to me
To watch it grow inside yourself
To feel your heart beside itself

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know you've given all you can)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(You do your best but it's still much too bad)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels

True love
It has no hiding place
It's not something you just put away
It's always there inside of you

Here we are, the two of us
So full of love, so little trust
But dying for some tenderness
Ooohhh, but too afraid to take the step

Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know what it can put you through)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(There's nothing funny if it's killing you)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels

I know if there is any chance
For us to find our happiness
We've got to learn to let it go
Ohhh oh, forget all the pain we knew
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
Sometimes it hurts it hurts to even laugh
And it hurts like hell

I don't know what's in store, but together we can open any door

Until You Come Back to Me  (That’s What I’m Gonna Do),,30 Greatest Hits,"19 ContributorsUntil You Come Back to Me  (That’s What I’m Gonna Do) Lyrics
Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door (Your door)
Tap on your window pane (Tap on your window pane)
I want to tell you, baby
Changes I've been going through
Missing you, listen you

'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
I'm going to swallow my pride (My pride)
I'm going to beg you to please, baby please see me (Baby won't you see me?)
I'm going to walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true
All for you baby

'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do

Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea (Hear my plea)
I've got to make you see (Make you see)
That our love is dying (Our love is dying)

Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must, somehow I must, how I must explain
I'm going to rap on your door (Your door)
Tap on your window pane (Tap on your window pane)
I'm going to camp by your steps
Until I get through to you (Uuuh)
I've got to change your view, baby

'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do

I'm going to rap on your door (Rap on)
Tap on your window pane (Tap on)
Open out baby, I’m gonna rap on your door (Rap on)

Willing to Forgive,1994-02-22,Greatest Hits 1980-1994,"4 ContributorsWilling to Forgive Lyrics
I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her?
Lay down beside her?
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it?
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets
You might also like
Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when a baby girl found out

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
(I'm gonna mess around some time)
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I...I'm in love

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

A Rose Is Still a Rose,1998-02-10,A Rose Is Still a Rose,"7 ContributorsA Rose Is Still a Rose Lyrics
Listen, dear
I realise that you've been hurt, deep
Because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when and where
We're all precious in his sight
And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)
You might also like
Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she gets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him, your life goes on
Without him, your life goes on
And without him, your life goes on
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)2Embed"
