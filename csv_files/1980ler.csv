Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,1982-11-30,The Ultimate Fan Extras Collection,"262 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsHebrewFrançaisDeutschBosanskiItalianoРусскийBillie Jean Lyrics
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee, ah, hee-hee-hee)

Hee, hoo

She says I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no, hoo, ohh)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (No)
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)
She says I am the one

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)

The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Why?

Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff

Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Go when the going gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Hey, baby, do what you please

Though you're far away, I am here to stay

Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

She said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high

Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free

Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

Y-O-U, you wanna?

I see you coming and I don't wanna know your name
(L-U-V, Madonna)
I see you coming and you're gonna have to change the game
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Would you like to try? Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you'll do fine as long as you don't lie to me
And pretend to be what you’re not

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world

Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let's forget about time and dance our lives away

In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
'Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say,  ""What have I got to lose?""

And, honey, I say, little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)

You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

Ooohhhh, baby, ohhh

Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God, one day, struck me blind
Your beauty, I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one
That night, I had to call you
I was rappin' 'til the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you were afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?

If God, one day, struck me blind
Your beauty, I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know you know that I ain't cheatin', baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial (Crucial)
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride--
Well, maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare
To your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
You own my heart, you own my mind
I truly adore you
I truly adore you, darlin'
Adore you
You don't know what you mean to me, baby
Baby, baby
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
Adore you

Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know that you know, without you, there is no me
There is no me
Without you, there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is too weak to define how much I adore
You child, you child
The last words you hear
Be with me, darlin', 'til the end of all time
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body
I'll give you my time
For all time, I am with you

Uh, yeah

Good morning ladies and gentlemen
""What hotel number is she in?""
Boys and motherfucking girls
""319, 319""
""Cool""
This is your captain with no name speaking
And I'm here to rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control
Are you ready?

Ah, Pussy Control, oh
Ah, Pussy Control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day, over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell 'em what she told me
Girl, you need Pussy Control'""
Are you ready?

Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love, Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
'Bout how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
You can go platinum four times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody want to hear that
'Cause this somebody here don't want to know
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control""
Are you ready?

Ah, Pussy Control, oh
Ah, Pussy Control, oh
With one more verse to the story
I need another piece of your ear
I want to hip you all to the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
'Cause I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rolling four-deep
Three sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl driving her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said ""Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here
I fear you're lonely and you want to know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I want to be
But it's going to be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want to sell, sell, sell
Seventy-five, we need another... eighty-five, eighty-five here — sold!
Can I tell you what I'm thinking that you already know?
You need a motherfucker that respects your name""
Now say it, Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Ah, Pussy Control, oh
Ah, Pussy Control, oh

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make 'em act like they know
You are, was, and always will be Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Peace and be wild
Aah, Pussy Control
Say what, huh?
Oh
Oh no, don't you think about calling her a ho
Are you ready?
You juvenile delinquent
Best sit your ass down
Talking about Pussy Control
Huh, can you dig it?

Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?

You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked, the things you said
I was so nonchalant
I didn't want you to be misled
But I've got to have you, baby
I got to have you in my bed
You said:
""I'm just a virgin, and I'm
On my way to be wed
You're such a hunk
So full of spunk""

I'll give you head 'til you're burning up
Head 'til you get enough

But the tracker you got from vaccination (Keeps playing)

It was 7:45, we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy
Third in line was me
All of us were ordinary
Compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20
And every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine
And a side order of ham
And if you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes, I wondered
If the mates were in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it
When Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died

Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips

Well, earlier, I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
Fightin' with lover's past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast

Well, I ordered: ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't too hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said: ""It sound like a real man to me
(You're kinda cute)
You're kinda cute, you wanna take a bath?""
(Do you wanna, do you wanna?)
... Bath?

Oh, I said: ""Cool, but I'm leavin' my pants on (What you say?)
'Cause I'm kinda goin' with someone""
She said: ""Sound like a real man to me
Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song,"" she said
And it was Joni singing: ""Help me, I think I'm falling""
(Drring) The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then and there, I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)

I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
(Tell us what you did, what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fightin' stopped
Next time, I'll do it sooner

Your skin's not covering and resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

Get out of your own way, oh, ah
Get out of your own way, oh, ah

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

Fight back
Don't take it lying down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are looking for someone to lead them
The master's looking for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said

Get out of your own way, oh, ah

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright

I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way


Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

Blessed are the arrogant
For their's the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain13Embed"
U2,Every Breaking Wave,2014-09-09,Songs Of Innocence (Deluxe),"41 ContributorsEvery Breaking Wave Lyrics
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
But it's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

If you go
If you go your way and I'll go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?66Embed"

All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
On New Year's Day

I will be with you again
I will be with you again

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says

Say it's true, it's true
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

And so we're told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes New Year's Day

You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone

You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there, it's yours to take
I was told I'd feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

This is a song
This is a song for someone

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'm a long, a long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out44Embed"

When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good, and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh, you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

I been crying out, ""How bad can a good time be?""
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head, can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul, it can't be bought
Your mind can wander

It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music

Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want

But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

But all the promises we make

If you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, yes I would
If I could, I would let it go
Surrender, dislocate

If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame

If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
Into the light and to the day
Hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo! Hoo, hoo!

If I could, I would let it go
This desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation
Revelation, in temptation
Isolation, desolation

Let it go and so fade away

The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years, I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control

You think it's easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it's easier
To know your own tricks
Well, it's the hardest thing you'll ever do

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul

Till somebody else was in control

I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul

Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control (Someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)

God knows it's not easy
Taking on the shape of someone else's pain

I'm not afraid
Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you (Oh)
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

I will not forsake
The colours that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see

And you are such a fool
To worry like you do (Oh, oh)
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

I was unconscious, half-asleep
The water is warm till you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along the stony pass
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along the stony pass
It's just a moment
This time will pass8Embed"

Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars

Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Look around, look around
Look around, it's a sound
Look around, look around

That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky

In a person, in a country, when you believe the lie

There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action not to fantasy
The end of the dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be my sanctuary?

So high, elevation

Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul

Digging up my soul
