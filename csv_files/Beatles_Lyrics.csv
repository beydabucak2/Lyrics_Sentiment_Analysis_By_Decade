Yesterday,1965-09-13,The Beatles (The Original Studio Recordings),"109 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsDeutschYesterday Lyrics
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

In My Life,1965-12-03,The Beatles (The Original Studio Recordings),"74 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschIn My Life Lyrics
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Who is it for?

Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there

Something in her style that shows me

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

If we must start again
Well, we will know for sure
That I will love you
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
Always to return to me

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if you go away
I know you'll never stay
You might also like
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ooh)
(Ah)

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you

(Ooh) Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well (Ooh)
My Michelle
(Uuuh)
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble (Uuuh)

I love you, I love you, I love you
(Ooh, ooh)
That's all I want to say
(Ooh) Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand

(Ooh) Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble (Ooh)

I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see (Ooh)
Oh, what you mean to me (Ooh, ooh)
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you (Ooh, ooh)
You might also like

I want you, I want you, I want you (Ooh, ooh)
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do, I'm telling you so you'll understand

(Ooh) Michelle, ma belle (Ooh, ooh)
Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle (Mmm)18Embed"
