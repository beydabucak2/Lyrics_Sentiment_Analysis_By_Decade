Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this morning
Could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care

'Cause they say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us
My mind says, ""Prepare to fight""
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say,  ""What have I got to lose?""

And, honey, I say, little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, ""Baby, have you got enough gas?""

You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

Ooh, oooh, oooh

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)

'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red Corvette right in the ground

Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down

You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

Ooohhhh, baby, ohhh

Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God, one day, struck me blind
Your beauty, I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one
That night, I had to call you
I was rappin' 'til the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you were afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?

That's why
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God, one day, struck me blind
Your beauty, I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know you know that I ain't cheatin', baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial (Crucial)
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride--
Well, maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare
To your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
You own my heart, you own my mind
I truly adore you
I truly adore you, darlin'
Adore you
You don't know what you mean to me, baby
Baby, baby
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
Adore you

Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know that you know, without you, there is no me
There is no me
Without you, there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is too weak to define how much I adore
You child, you child
The last words you hear
Be with me, darlin', 'til the end of all time
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body
I'll give you my time
For all time, I am with you

Good morning ladies and gentlemen
""What hotel number is she in?""
Boys and motherfucking girls
""319, 319""
""Cool""
This is your captain with no name speaking
And I'm here to rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control
Are you ready?

Ah, Pussy Control, oh
Ah, Pussy Control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day, over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell 'em what she told me
Girl, you need Pussy Control'""
Are you ready?

Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love, Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
'Bout how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
You can go platinum four times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody want to hear that
'Cause this somebody here don't want to know
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control""
Are you ready?

Ah, Pussy Control, oh
Ah, Pussy Control, oh
With one more verse to the story
I need another piece of your ear
I want to hip you all to the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
'Cause I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rolling four-deep
Three sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl driving her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said ""Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here
I fear you're lonely and you want to know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I want to be
But it's going to be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want to sell, sell, sell
Seventy-five, we need another... eighty-five, eighty-five here — sold!
Can I tell you what I'm thinking that you already know?
You need a motherfucker that respects your name""
Now say it, Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Ah, Pussy Control, oh
Ah, Pussy Control, oh

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make 'em act like they know
You are, was, and always will be Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Peace and be wild
Aah, Pussy Control
Say what, huh?
Oh
Oh no, don't you think about calling her a ho
Are you ready?
You juvenile delinquent
Best sit your ass down
Talking about Pussy Control
Huh, can you dig it?

Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want

But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you

Sister,1990-10-08,Dirty Mind,"21 ContributorsSister Lyrics
I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was 32, lovely and loose
She don't wear no underwear
She said it only gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stopping the juice
My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality
Showed me where it's supposed to go
A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out
She took a whip to me until I shout
""Oh, motherfucker, sister,  motherfucker
Can't you understand?""

Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I want to lose in you, baby, can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby!

(Hey, lover)
All I want to see is the love in your eyes
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
(Hey, lover)
All I wanna feel is a burning flame
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me, girl

If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may

Starfish and Coffee,1987-03-31,Sign O’ the Times (Super Deluxe Edition),"16 ContributorsStarfish and Coffee Lyrics
It was 7:45, we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy
Third in line was me
All of us were ordinary
Compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20
And every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine
And a side order of ham
And if you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes, I wondered
If the mates were in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it
When Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died
You know what we found?

Cynthia had a happy face
Just like the one she draws
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singing

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand

Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around
Take me, baby, kiss me all over

I’ve never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby

Color me taken aback
Crucial, I think I want you

The Ballad of Dorothy Parker,1987-03-31,Sign O’ the Times (Super Deluxe Edition),"22 ContributorsThe Ballad of Dorothy Parker Lyrics
Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips

Well, earlier, I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
Fightin' with lover's past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast

Well, I ordered: ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't too hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said: ""It sound like a real man to me
(You're kinda cute)
You're kinda cute, you wanna take a bath?""
(Do you wanna, do you wanna?)
... Bath?

Oh, I said: ""Cool, but I'm leavin' my pants on (What you say?)
'Cause I'm kinda goin' with someone""
She said: ""Sound like a real man to me
Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song,"" she said
And it was Joni singing: ""Help me, I think I'm falling""
(Drring) The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then and there, I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
Well

My pants were wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie 'cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead, she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (Ha-ha, ha-ha)
I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
(Tell us what you did, what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fightin' stopped
Next time, I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Swee-eet, hee, hee, hoo-ooh
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker

Well

I get delirious whenever you're near

Stupid look on my face
It comes to making a pass, pretty mama
I just can't win a race

Because I get delirious
Delirious

I get delirious when you hold my hand
Body gets so weak I can hardly stand

Baby, you got to stop
'Cause if you don't, I'm going to explode
And, girl, I got a lot
