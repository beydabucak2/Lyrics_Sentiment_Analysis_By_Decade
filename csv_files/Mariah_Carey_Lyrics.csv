I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

We Belong Together,2005-03-29,#1 to Infinity,"89 ContributorsWe Belong Together Lyrics
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart

I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe

Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's

And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside
(Underneath the guise of a smile)
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that that I'm suffering

Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it

So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

Promise that you'll keep me warm

When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me (I will know you're mine)
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly, butterfly (My butterfly)
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly (Fly)
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Fly
Spread your wings and fly
